        <hr1>The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher,<br>
             where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent,<br>
             encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.<br>
             The formula used means that each letter encrypts to one other letter, and back again,<br>
             meaning the cipher is essentially a standard substitution cipher with a rule governing<br>
             which letter goes to which. As such, it has the weaknesses of all substitution ciphers.<br>
             Each letter is enciphered with the function (ax + b) mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift.</hr1>
